# PyBitWarden
Python Implementation of Bitwarden Core.

This allows one to self-host a small Bitwarden server. Bitwarden Core is large and is implemented as though it would be hosted on an enterprise server. PyBitWarden was designed with the intention of being able to be hosted on a Raspberry Pi.

# Technologies
The app was created using the Flask mciro web framework and SQLAlchemy for the Database ORM. The development version will use a sqlite3 database, while production uses a MySQL database.
